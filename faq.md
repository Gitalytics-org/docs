## :question: What is the difference to other git analysis sites?

:exclamation: Instead of analyzing only one repository, we can analyze an entire workspace. A feature, that many other products lack.


## :question: How secure is this site?

:exclamation: We use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate a user, saving you the hassle of creating a new account and a new vulnerability. Furthermore, Gitalytics only has read-only access to your GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket repositories.

## :question: What exactly is a workspace?

:exclamation: **For GitHub** it represents either your Account with your personal repositories or an Organization that you are part of.
(Note: The Organization needs to approve our access to these Repositories)<br/>
You will be able to select wich of these you want to analyze, if you have more than one Workspace.

## :question: How can I delete all my Data here?

:exclamation: We currently don't have a builtin feature to delete all your data.<br/>
But your are able to [remove our access](remove-access/index.md)<br/>
If your still want to delete all your data then please contact us in any way and we will do it manually.
